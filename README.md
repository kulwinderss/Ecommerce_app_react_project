Ecommerce React app

Problem statement
Create the frontend for an ecommerce website. You can check out the mockups down below.

Instructions
Use the following service to create a dummy ecommerce api service (create good amount of data): https://my-json-server.typicode.com/
Functionality
Navbar
Show cart items count
Show relevant navigation links
All products page
Show list of products from the API (using the above server)
Each product is editable by clicking on the “pencil” button. And we can edit that product inline. On finish editing the product, show some sort of Alert/Notification
Each product is deletable, on clicking of the delete button you should delete the product and show some sort of Alert/Notification
Implement a sort button. On clicking it should sort by “price” and show a cross button just beside it (see the sort view). On clicking the cross button remove the sort.
Give button to add a product to cart
Create page
On clicking of the Add button add the product in the DB, and show some sort of Alert/Notification
Product detail page
Show all the details of a product
Give button to add a product to cart
Cart page
Show all the items in the cart
Handle errors and success alerts etc.
Handle errors as well from the API and show appropriate Alert/Notification
You can use react-router if you want. It’s not mandatory.
You have to use redux. It’s mandatory.
Bonus feature: Make the redux data persistent such that after refresh, the cart items etc remains same

You are ALLOWED to style the app the way you like. Do whatever you want with the styling. ONLY the functionality should work.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet
DO NOT cheat with other students, I am trusting you all for this one!
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem in code and showing the final product. The video can be UPTO 3 mins long. Please don’t record videos longer than that.
Upload the code to github.
Host your code on github (using gh-pages)/netlify/firebase etc.. (This is mandatory)
Once you have recorded the video ,upload it on youtube (unlisted or whatever), drive or wherever you want to upload it. If no video is submitted, the solution will be rejected.
